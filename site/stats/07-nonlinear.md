# Nonlinear Effects

- What if relationship between X and Y can't be described by a straight line? Nonlinear effects
- What does adding a nonlinear effect do to our model? As before, just with a term for X^2/X^3
- Adding terms will boost R2 - how do we decide if this is worth it? AIC
- What are some examples of how we use nonlinear effects? Age trajectories often not straight
