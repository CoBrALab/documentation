# Nonlinear Effects

<ul>
    <li>What if relationship between X and Y can't be described by a straight line? Nonlinear effects</li>
    <li>What does adding a nonlinear effect do to our model? As before, just with a term for X^2/X^3</li>
    <li>Adding terms will boost R2 - how do we decide if this is worth it? AIC</li>
    <li>What are some examples of how we use nonlinear effects? Age trajectories often not straight</li>
