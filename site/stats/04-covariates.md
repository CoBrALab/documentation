# Covariates

- What if some other variable might actually be predicting Y through its relationship with X? Add as a covariate
- What are some common covariates we might want to "remove" the effect of? Age, sex
- How does my interpretation of the beta coefficient change as I add covariates? Residual variance independent of all other covariates
- How can adding covariates impact significance? Multicollinearity/impacts on standard error
