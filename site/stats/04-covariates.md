# Covariates

<ul>
    <li>What if some other variable might actually be predicting Y through its relationship with X? Add as a covariate</li>
    <li>What are some common covariates we might want to "remove" the effect of? Age, sex</li>
    <li>How does my interpretation of the beta coefficient change as I add covariates? Residual variance independent of all other covariates</li>
    <li>How can adding covariates impact significance? Multicolinearity/impacts on standard error</li>
</ul>
