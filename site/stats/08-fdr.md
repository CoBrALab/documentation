# Multiple Comparisons

<ul>
    <li>What happens if I do many tests? Rate of false positives goes way up if adopting conventional significance threshold</li>
    <li>What's the usual solution to this? Bonferroni - just adjust threshold based on number of tests</li>
    <li>Why don't we do this? Usuaully analyzing tens of thousands of voxels/vertices - highest resolution possible, not imposing any predefined hypothesis on regions</li>
    <li>What do we do instead? FDR - more liberal, can expect results to include false positives</li>
    <li>Do nonsignificant effects "not exist"? Not necessarily - transparent visualization, contours for significance</li>
</ul>
