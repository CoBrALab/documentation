# Linear Model Basics

- What are we testing for with an LM? If there's a linear association between X and Y - if a straight line describes their relationship
- How can I interpret how strong my relationship is? Beta coefficient
- What kinds of variables can I use in an LM? Continuous/binary, categorical with caveats
