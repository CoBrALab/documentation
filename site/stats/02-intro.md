# Linear Model Basics

<ul>
    <li>What are we testing for with an LM? If there's a linear association between X and Y - if a straight line describes their relationship</li>
    <li>How can I interpret how strong my relationship is? Beta coefficient</li>
    <li>What kinds of variables can I use in an LM? Continuous/binary, categorical with caveats</li>
</ul>
