# Interpreting Results

<ul>
    <li>How can I tell if my betas are "strong enough"? t-stat/corresponding p-value</li>
    <li>How can I "boost" significance? Why? Sample size/standard error</li>
    <li>How can I compare betas between studies? Standardized betas - now in units of standard dev</li>
    <li>What's the difference between interpreting the significance vs. the effect size of my result?</li>
    <li>What's variance explained/R2?</li>
</ul>
