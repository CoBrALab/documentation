# Interpreting Results

- How can I tell if my betas are "strong enough"? t-stat/corresponding p-value
- How can I "boost" significance? Why? Sample size/standard error
- How can I compare betas between studies? Standardized betas - now in units of standard dev
- What's the difference between interpreting the significance vs. the effect size of my result?
- What's variance explained/R2?
