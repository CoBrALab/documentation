The Computational Brain Anatomy (CoBrA) Laboratory is located at the Cerebral Imaging Centre at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute (the primary psychiatric institution affiliated with McGill University, Montreal, Canada)

Our laboratory is interested in the anatomy and function of the brain and how it matures through adolescence, how it stays healthy through the normal ageing process, and how alterations in brain anatomy are related to neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia and Parkinson's disease and neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder.

Our group is a multi-disciplinary group of neuroscientists, psychologists, computer scientists, engineers, and physicists all working towards a common goal of improving our understanding of the structure-function relationships of the brain through health and illness. We believe that this integrated approach can significantly accelerate discovery and will hopefully improve our understanding of adaptive and maladaptive brain changes.

We use a translational neuroscientific approach that integrates sophisticated computational methods in animal models and population-based human studies as a means of parsing the complexity of brain structure and anatomy.

We publicly disseminate much of the algorithmic and atlas work that we do in an effort to promote open and reproducible science.
